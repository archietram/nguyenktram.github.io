description: "Discover what happens when AI talks to itself without human guidance. Learn how image-generation and description models converge to just 12 generic visual motifs such as stormy lighthouses, gothic cathedrals, and pastoral scenes, revealing AI's built-in drift toward 'visual elevator music' and why human collaboration is essential to keep creativity alive."

Imagine you are playing a game of "Telephone" with a group of friends. You whisper a complex story about a space-traveling cat to the person next to you. By the time that story reaches the tenth person, it has probably changed into something much simpler, like "the cat sat on the mat." 

According to a fascinating new research paper by Arend Hintze and colleagues, titled *"Autonomous language-image generation loops converge to generic visual motifs,"* artificial intelligence does the exact same thing. When AI systems are left to "talk" to each other without human help, they don’t get more creative, they actually get much more boring. They eventually stop making unique art and start producing what the researchers call **"visual elevator music"**.

### **The Experiment: Letting the Robots Talk**

To understand how AI "thinks" over time, the researchers set up a closed loop between two different types of AI. 

1.  **The Artist:** They used a model called **Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)**, which creates images based on text descriptions.
2.  **The Critic:** They used a model called **LLaVA**, which "looks" at an image and writes a description of what it sees.

The researchers started with a diverse set of 100 very different prompts. For example, one prompt was about a politician worried about a peace deal, while another was about travelers starting an impossible journey. 

Then, they let the loop begin: The Artist made a picture from the prompt. Then, the Critic looked at that picture and wrote a new description. That new description was fed back to the Artist to make a second picture, and so on. They did this 100 times for each starting idea, creating a "trajectory" or a path of how the images changed over time.

### **What Happens When AI Is Left Alone?**

You might think that because AI is so powerful, it would keep coming up with wild, new ideas forever. But the results were the opposite. No matter how weird or specific the starting prompt was, the AI systems eventually drifted away from the original idea.

Even more surprising, they didn’t just drift randomly; **they all ended up in the same few places**. Out of 700 different "trips" through this AI loop, the models converged to just **12 dominant visual motifs**. 

These 12 categories are the "visual elevator music" mentioned earlier. They are images that look like high-quality but generic stock photography you might see on a travel website or a corporate brochure. 

According to the sources, some of these 12 "attractors" included:
*   **Stormy lighthouses**.
*   **Gothic cathedrals** and ornate palatial interiors.
*   **Action sports** imagery.
*   **Urban night scenes** with atmospheric lighting.
*   **Pastoral villages** and natural landscapes with animals.

Essentially, the AI "collapsed" into these safe, common themes.

### **The "Randomness Knob" Doesn't Save It**

In AI, there is a setting called **"temperature"**. Think of this like a "randomness knob." If the temperature is low, the AI is very literal and focused. If the temperature is high, the AI gets more "creative" and takes more risks with its words and images.

The researchers tested seven different temperature levels to see if being more "random" would help the AI stay creative. It didn't. While higher temperatures made the AI change its mind more often from step to step, the system still eventually crashed into those same 12 boring categories. This suggests that the problem isn't just a lack of randomness; it is a **deeply built-in limit** of how these AI systems are designed.

### **Why Does This Happen? The "Cognitive Bias" of the Internet**

The researchers found that this phenomenon is very similar to how human culture works. In the early 1900s, a psychologist named Frederic Bartlett found that when humans try to remember and pass on stories or drawings, we "level" them, meaning we simplify them and make them match what we already expect to see.

AI does this because it is trained on massive amounts of data from the internet. If you look at millions of pictures on the web, there are a lot of lighthouses, cathedrals, and pretty sunsets. These are "high-probability" images, the stuff that appears most often. 

When the AI describer (LLaVA) looks at a messy or unique image, its "brain" tries to make sense of it by comparing it to what it "knows" from its training. It takes a weird, unique shape and says, "That looks like a lighthouse". Once it says "lighthouse," the next AI generates a perfect, generic lighthouse. The original, unique idea is lost forever.

### **Why Should We Care?**

This study matters for anyone who uses AI for art, writing, or schoolwork. 

**1. The Risk of "Boring" Culture**
If we start using AI to generate and then judge our content without humans in the loop, our visual world could become very repetitive. We might end up in a world filled with "visual elevator music", content that is technically perfect but has no soul, surprise, or new ideas.

**2. AI Isn't Truly Creative (Yet)**
Real creativity often comes from taking a risk or seeing something in a way no one else has before. This study shows that current AI systems, when left to their own devices, do the opposite: they run away from novelty and hide in the safety of common tropes.

**3. Humans Are Essential**
The researchers conclude that **human-AI collaboration** is likely necessary to keep things interesting. Humans provide the "corrective feedback" that keeps the AI from drifting into its 12 favorite boring topics. Without us to say, "No, keep the space cat, don't make it a lighthouse," the AI will always take the easiest, most predictable path.

### **The Bottom Line**

The paper reveals that while AI is a powerful tool, it has a "gravity" that pulls it toward the average. If we want to use AI to expand our creativity, we can't just let the machines talk to themselves. We have to stay in the conversation to make sure the "telephone game" doesn't end with a world full of lighthouses and cathedrals. 

As the authors put it, these systems naturally drift toward "visual elevator music". It’s up to us to make sure the music stays worth listening to.
